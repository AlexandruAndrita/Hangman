### Description

[@Hangman](https://github.com/AlexandruAndrita/Hangman) is a game where one has to guess a random word having a maximum 6 tries. <br/><br/>
The user could choose to play again under a different name should he wish to or just quit the app.

The words are chosen randomly from a set of a words (from a text file).

Additonally, the implementation of the game does not allow repeated names. <br/><br/>
